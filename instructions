Be sure to have a copy of jQuery library and font awesome in your header message. If already using other scripts created , you may already have this. But double check....

<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="//use.fontawesome.com/6ccd97559b.js"></script>
 

 

2. Place this in your header message

<script>
//THIS NEEDS TO BE PLACED IN HEADER AND IS USED TO GO BACK IN HISTORY FOR MFL'S LIVE SCORING
if(document.getElementById("body_ajax_ls")) {
	var ls_liveScoringWeekCheck = parseInt(location.href.substr( location.href.indexOf("W2=")+3 , 2 ));
	if(ls_liveScoringWeekCheck>0&&ls_liveScoringWeekCheck<liveScoringWeek) {
		liveScoringWeek = parseInt(location.href.substr( location.href.indexOf("W2=")+3 , 2 ));
	}
}
</script>
 

 

3. Place the following in a footer message (THERE ARE 2 SCRIPTS IN THIS SECTION ONLY INSTALL THE ONE THAT DESCRIBES YOUR LEAGUE - H2H or ALL PLAY)

<script>
var ls_scoreboardName = "ROTOM SCOREBOARD";   //enter text to name your scoreboard
var showTeamName = false;                      //set to true to display franchise names in scoreboard header
var showTeamIcon = true;                       //set to true to display franchise icons in scoreboard header
var ls_includeProjections = true;              //set to true to display projections next to player scores
var ls_includeInjuryStatus = true;             //set to true to display injury status as per the norm
var ls_excludeIR = true;                       //set to true to remove players on fantasy IR
var ls_excludeTaxi = true;                     //set to true to remove players on taxi squad
var ls_popup_abbrev_name_icon = 2;             // -1=disable; 0=abbrev; 1=name; 2=icon
var ls_orig_proj_when_final = true;            //set true to change pace to projection when games go final
var ls_popup_status = true;                    //set true to add status of player to popup
var ls_box_abbrev_name_icon = 2;               //0=abbrev; 1=name; 2=icon; 3=icon+abbrev; 4=icon+name
var ls_hide_bye_teams = false;                 //set to true to hide boxscore matchup teams on bye weeks
