# PokeScoreBoard
Goal: To combine my Google Sheet scoreboard (https://i.imgur.com/Ldmrb7P.png) with a custom scoreboard (https://www.dagrafixdesigns.com/images/gallery-zoom-3.jpg) for the Pokemon Dynasty League.

Specific changes that are needed:
   - [ ] Add a column that displays associated TYPE with player (based on NFL team, see NFLTypeMap.js)
   - [ ] Add a column that displays the modifier for the NFL player vs. defending team (see modifiers.js)
   - [ ] Add a column that displays the result of the player's score multiplied by the modifier
   - [ ] Remove S.O.S column
   - [ ] Remove Pace column and Pace total
   - [ ] Remove Game column
